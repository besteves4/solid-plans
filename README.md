# Platform for Access Control and GDPR Rights Management in Solid

With GDPR, users of Web services were provided new data-related rights. Solid, a protocol for managing data in decentralised datastores, is an ideal solution to ensure that users regain control of their data as intended by the GDPR.
We will develop an open-source Solid server extension which will use fine-grained access control policies to determine the access to data stored in Solid Pods. This solution will be based on Semantic Web vocabularies, such as DPV or ODRL, which will be used to design a privacy matching mechanism to establish terms for disclosing personal data, favouring the data economy, while data sovereignty and data subjects’ privacy is preserved. Solid developers will benefit from having a mechanism to request data in line with data protection terms. Users will be able to specify the conditions for access to their data in detail. Open-source software will also be developed to assist users in exercising and managing their GDPR rights. The software will allow users to revoke consent, help them access data that was used by a certain application or shared with specific recipients for particular purposes or request the erasure of data that was shared with third parties.
